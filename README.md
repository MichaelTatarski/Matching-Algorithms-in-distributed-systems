# NEidI AVA - matching algorithms in PubSub systems

This project is part of the NEiDI course of the winter lecture 2020/2021. The objective of our project is to implement different matching algorithms in a Pub/Sub system and compare them with regard to their time efficiency on a testbed. In order to accomplish that, we will develop a simple data and filter model as well.
